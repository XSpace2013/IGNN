## Full results
- Please see [simulation.ipynb](https://github.com/hamrel-cxu/Invertible-Graph-Neural-Network-iGNN/blob/main/simulation.ipynb) regarding simulated results.
- Please see [real_data.ipynb](https://github.com/hamrel-cxu/Invertible-Graph-Neural-Network-iGNN/blob/main/real_data.ipynb) regarding real-data experiments.
- The `.gif` below visualizes how iGNN transports original densities (i.e., $X|Y$) to their corresponding ($H|Y$). The top row plots the Wasserstein-2 penalty at each block (over 40 blocks), where larger values indicate more drastic amount of transportation by the block.
